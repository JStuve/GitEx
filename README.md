## üíª Repository Overview

`src/chrome-services`: Injected scripts that load onto a users webpage. For each feature there should be a unique script. 

NOTE: Future update will pull these scripts outside of the `src/` directory.

`src/components`: UI elements for the extensions React application. These should be simple, 'dumb', components. (e.g. Buttons, Tabs, Dropdown, ect.)

`src/models`: All of our interfaces, types, const, enums, will live in this folder.

`src/utilities`: Small static classes used to improved common Typescript logic blocks.

`src/**`: Root of the application contains all the React pages and boiler plate code.

NOTE: Future update will isolate the pages into it's own directory.
